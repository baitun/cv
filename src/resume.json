    "summary": "I am web developer with 4+ years of experience. I have experience with front-end (ES6, TypeScript, React.JS) and back-end (Node.JS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis), but I prefer to do front-end. I’m a software engineer looking for my next opportunity to continue with React/Redux/TypeScript. I’m looking for a company that can help me grow, while exploring more front end work. I think that the code says more words, so it's better to look at my projects on https://github.com/baitun",
